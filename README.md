# MicroKTANE

During my junior year at CHC, I was in the robotics class, a do-anything project-based class. This was one of many projects, which replicates the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes using a modular system with ESP32s. Omitted are the Wire Sequences and Knobs modules, as this was developed within a one weekend crunch. 

`Wokwi` folder contains code and digrams for the website [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), an online microcontoller emulator that is easy to develop in.
`ESP32` folder contains the .ino files pushed to the microcontrollers.
